# Project Overview
### Primary Objective:
The main goal of this sprint is to create a simple yet interactive web-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and active GitHub Copilot support. The goal of the sprint is not just to create the game, but to also engage in prompt-driven development and understand ways Copilot can augment our efficiency and creativity as we code.


### Core Features & Deliverables:


- A working interface to the game (e.g., memory match or quiz game).
- Complete game logic including: handling input; maintaining score; feedback mechanisms.
- A styled UI using few lines of CSS for a streamlined user experience.
- Copilot enabled code contributions in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- A playable demo with minimal interaction for the mid-sprint presentation.


### Milestones and Timeline
**Session 1 - Sprint Planning:**
Nail down the game idea, assign roles and permissions, and confirm tech stack.


**By “Game Structure with Copilot” session:**
Have the core game logic mapped with Copilot, stubs for core functions, and a full outline of game flows (start, play, end).


**By “UI Styling” session:**
Have the overall HTML structure done and styles applied with CSS along with buttons, text and game area layout.


**By Mid-Sprint demo + feedback:**
Show up with a playable version with at least one level/round with both functionality and styling.


**Final sprint session:**
Tidy up the UI, fix bugs, update gameplay as needed and get everything ready for the final submission and demo.

### Team Roles and Responsibilities
**Sera Shine:**
Responsible for gaming logic using JavaScript and Copilot with an emphasis on writing clean and comprehensible code.


**Levi Samuel K:**
Responsible for creating the HTML structure and supporting the generation of prompts to give Copilot for accurate and fast code generation.


**Issac Antony:**
Responsible for CSS Styling, visual design, and ensuring that the user interface is engaging and usable.


**R John Robert (Me):**
Responsible for GitHub commits, managing the Copilot suggestions, and documenting the strategy for the team.



**Role Strategy:**

Although primary roles will be pursued consistently to ensure focus and efficiency, we will take turns changing roles occasionally for peer reviews and support, especially if someone finishes their work early or runs into blockers.


**Communication & Coordination:**

We will use a collaborative Google Doc for planning and use Discord for daily brief updates. We will maintain all code through GitHub, utilizing proper commit messages and pull requests while working with separate branches for each aspect of the project.

### Expected Challenges and Strategies
**Challenge 1: Overdependence on Copilot**

**Strategy:** All suggestions produced by Copilot will be reviewed by the team to check for understanding, correctness, relevance and correctness in the context of the project prior to merging.


**Challenge 2: Time Management**

**Strategy:** Using weekly milestones and individual commitments to generate working time outside of class will establish a steady and predictable means of making forward progress.


**Challenge 3: Merge Conflicts or Code Duplicity**

**Strategy:** Each member will be assigned specific sections of code and will use GitHub branches and pull requests combined with peer reviews to reduce conflicts.


**Challenge 4: Miscommunication or Misalignment**

**Strategy:** Short daily check-ins in chat and one scheduled call weekly will help keep members aligned and have blockers addressed early and keep communication unified.
